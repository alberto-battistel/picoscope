drivers must be installed. The simples way to install the kernel
drivers is to install PicoScope or PicoLog. Instructions on manually
installing these drivers is as follows:

1 - Copy picopp.inf to <winroot>\inf
2 - Copy picopp.sys to <winroot>\system32\drivers
3 - Plug the device in and follow the new hardware wizard.
